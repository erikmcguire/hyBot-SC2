# hy-SC2 Bot

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Zerg-based [Hy](https://github.com/hylang/hy) port of the Protoss-based [tutorials](https://pythonprogramming.net/starcraft-ii-ai-python-sc2-tutorial/) found on PythonProgramming.net using [Python-SC2](https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2), alongside the latter's Zerg-based [examples](https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2/tree/207d4f6f7682e3bd2bdc4d8683b9f19ddb1e4262/examples/zerg).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, it requires Hy to run, alongside the requirements for Python-SC2. It has been tested with hy 0.15.0+64.ga42e17a and Python 3.7.1.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hy is essentially the Pythonic analogue of Clojureâ€”in this case, Hy parses to the same ASTs that Python parses to; the language is somewhat unstable at present, but enjoyable to work with, giving an opportunity to progressively tinker with this bot as a 'symbolic' practice project.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The port is simple and straightforward for now, as I work through the tutorials and examples and examine where to best make use of more Hy-specific idioms.
